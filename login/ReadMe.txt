Dear Developer,
Thank you for downloading the code from https://codehow2.com. Please read the below points before using the code:

1) If you use XAMPP, please create a folder under xampp/htdocs. Keep all extracted files and folders under that folder. For example, we created a 'login' folder under xampp/htdocs. If you are using WAMP create the folder under wamp/www.

2) Create the table in your MySQL database using users.sql. For our example, we used test database. If you change the database name, make sure to update the database name in dbconnect.php

Feel free to post your queries, questions or feedback under the Comments section.
